## Research

<p> I have learnt that a portfolio is not just a collection of work, and rather a tool that allows students to generate insight on their own work and improve upon them. <br>
My goals compared to academic goals are shallow, and do not need as much analysis and criticism since they are but life goals and not academic and require a grade.<br>
Though if I was to set an academic goal, it would be to maintain a high GPA and graduate as soon as I can.
